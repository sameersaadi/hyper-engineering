    <p class="tagline">Engineering at the speed of thought</p>
    <p><strong>The game is changing—fast.</strong> AI isn't just speeding up coding. It's compressing the entire development lifecycle. Planning, reviews, coordination—all shrinking. Teams that lean in are <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/from-pilots-to-payoff-generative-ai-in-software-development-technology-report-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shipping in days what used to take months</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>The new leverage.</strong> One person with AI can deliver what used to take a whole squad. Specialists aren't going away—they're becoming <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/unlocking-the-value-of-ai-in-software-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">force multipliers</a>. Less time on logistics, more time on judgment.</p>
    <p><strong>The unlock is real.</strong> Some teams are struggling to make AI click. Others have found something that <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/research/research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feels like a cheat code</a>. Same tools, different results. The difference? How you set it up and how you think.</p>
    <p><strong>This only accelerates.</strong> Teams sitting this out aren't standing still—they're falling behind. The opportunity is now.</p>
    <p class="label">How we help</p>
    <p><strong>Need something built?</strong> We ship it—with you or for you. Embedded or hands-off, your call. Either way: working systems in days, not quarters.</p>
    <p><strong>Need your team to work this way?</strong> We teach by doing. Real projects, hands-on pairing, new muscle memory. Your engineers leave knowing how to think with AI, not just use it.</p>
